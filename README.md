[![CI](https://github.com/RePod/DivaAPworld-R/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RePod/DivaAPworld-R/actions/workflows/build.yml)

An ***Unofficial*** bleeding edge release of [the Upstream Testing Branch](https://github.com/Cynichill/DivaAPworld/tree/testing) (*UTB*) with [select PRs](diffs/) combined into one. See [`UPSTREAM_REF_APWORLD`](.github/workflows/build.yml) for specific UTB commit.

If/when [previously selected PRs are merged into UTB](https://github.com/Cynichill/DivaAPworld/pulls?q=is%3Apr+base%3Atesting+created%3A%3E2025-10-19T16%3A00%3A00Z+) <sup>(dated 1.4.0B)</sup> the corresponding `##_featurename.diff` will be removed as obsolete since the changes would come from UTB.

If the changes provided by UTB and the diffs applied by this Unofficial release sound useful, try it out.

If an issue is encountered with this release that is not in the latest Official I do accept issues here and will forward/handle them upstream. If there's a relevant [open pull request](https://github.com/Cynichill/DivaAPworld/pulls) it would be better to report there.
