[![CI](https://github.com/RePod/DivaAPworld-R/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RePod/DivaAPworld-R/actions/workflows/build.yml)

An ***unofficial*** bleeding edge version of [the upstream AP world](//github.com/Cynichill/DivaAPworld) with [select PRs](diffs/) combined into one.

This is intended primarily for testing while also getting fixes out sooner if the room host allows it.

If a bug is encountered and can be isolated, such as being freeplay related, please report it [upstream](//github.com/Cynichill/DivaAPworld/issues) or if possible the [relevant PR](//github.com/Cynichill/DivaAPworld/pulls) being applied by this unofficial version. The diff filenames start with their PR number.
