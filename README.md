[![CI](https://github.com/RePod/DivaAPworld-R/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RePod/DivaAPworld-R/actions/workflows/build.yml)

An ***unofficial*** bleeding edge version of [the Upstream Testing Branch](https://github.com/Cynichill/DivaAPworld/tree/testing) (*UTB*) with [select PRs](diffs/) combined into one. See [`UPSTREAM_REF`](.github/workflows/build.yml) for specific UTB commit.

If/when [previously selected PRs are merged into UTB](https://github.com/Cynichill/DivaAPworld/pulls?q=is%3Apr+base%3Atesting) the corresponding `##_featurename.diff` will be removed as obsolete since the changes would come from UTB.

If the changes provided by UTB and the diffs applied by this repo sound useful, try it out.
