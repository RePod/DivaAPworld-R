 ## Mod Songs
 **Note: Currently, using mod songs requires the seed to be [generated locally](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup_en#generating-a-multiplayer-game), not on the website. Hosting on the website afterwards is fine.**
 
-Open the **Mega Mix JSON Generator** from the Archipelago Launcher.
-
-Checked song packs will be included in the song selection pool and have their visibility in-game controlled when using the **Mega Mix Client**. Packs left unchecked will not be included in the selection pool and may remain visible in-game. Disable these manually, such as in their `config.toml`, if you do not want to see them.
+1. Open the **Mega Mix JSON Generator** from the Archipelago Launcher.
+2. Check song packs you would like to appear in your song selection pool. Unchecked packs will remain visible in game unless manually disabled.
+3. When done checking packs click **Generate Mod String**.
+4. In your YAML on the line for `megamix_mod_data` paste and format it as such:
+   - `megamix_mod_data: '{"MyFirstSongPack":[["MyFirstSong",144,224]]}'`
 
-When done checking packs click **Generate Mod String**. Linux users that experience clipboard issues *may* need to run the Archipelago Launcher and JSON Generator through a command line to get the output there.

 ## Troubleshooting
 
 ### Checks are not sending
 Make sure the **Mega Mix Client** is open and connected to a room.
 
-Try playing the BK song. If a success message does not appear on completion try restarting the **Mega Mix Client**.
+Play `-Archipelago Randomizer Enabled-`. If a success message does not appear in the **Client** on completion try restarting the **Client**.
 
 ### There are songs outside my specified difficulty settings
-To increase the success of seed generation the difficulty settings are conservatively expanded *until* a minimally viable song pool is found.
-
-If you do not like the results of the difficulty expansion consider less restrictive settings.
-
 Starting (`start_inventory`), Included (`include_songs`), and the Goal Song (`goal_song`) will *always* ignore difficulty settings.
